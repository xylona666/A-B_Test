# A-B_Test


As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention and game rounds.

 The data is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running.

 AB Testing ProcessÂ¶
Understanding business problem & data
Detect and resolve problems in the data (Missing Value, Outliers, Unexpected Value)
Look summary stats and plots
Apply hypothesis testing and check assumptions
Check Normality & Homogeneity
Apply tests (Shapiro, Levene Test, T-Test, Welch Test, Mann Whitney U Test)
Evaluate the results
Make inferences
Recommend business decision to your customer/director/ceo etc.



The variables are:

userid - a unique number that identifies each player.
version - whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the test group (gate_40 - a gate at level 40).
sum_gamerounds - the number of game rounds played by the player during the first week after installation
retention_1 - did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?
retention_7 - did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?
When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.
